**Overview**
Smart contract to mint NFT on SORA 

**Proposal goals**
To implement a smart contract for users to mint cryptographic assets on the SORA network

**Motivation**
Increase the scope of tokens to include non-fungible tokens for SORA ecosystem users. Increase Polkaswap functionality and bring native NFT to the SORA ecosystem

**Scope of work**
Objectives: Set up and implement a smart contract to mint and burn Non-fungible tokens on the SORA network as well as the implementation for frontend UI updates that include an interface to visualise NFT within a userâ€™s wallet 

Using FRAME pallet as a guideline (https://github.com/danforbes/pallet-nft) to develop the interface for managing non fungible tokens on the SORA network in accordance to SORA network standards for Gas and Complexity.

A unique hash value is to be calculated from the artwork (to form a Unique Resource Identifier) and assigned to the token holder, with the hash value stored on the blockchain.  

Develop the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of NFT in accordance to pre-existing token standards already implemented in the SORA network 

**Milestones** 
Project to begin October 2021 and be ready for testing by early 2022 and released to the public tentatively by mid 2022

**Deliverables** 
1-An asset pallet that mints, burns and lists NFT within the SORA network, 
2- A storage solution for token metadata off-chain. 
3- UI on Polkaswap that allows users to mint NFT, visualisation of user NFT within their wallet 

**Current roadblocks**
None 

**Project completion comprises of**
1) Pallet for NFT minting including the implementation of a user interface to mint and list NFT 
2) Functional user interface for owned NFT visualisation 
3) Update to liquidity source to implement NFT support
